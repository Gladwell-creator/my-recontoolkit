# 🔍 My Recon Toolkit

Welcome to my personal reconnaissance toolkit!  
This repo includes scripts, notes, and commands I use as I learn ethical hacking and penetration testing — one scan at a time.

## 🛠️ What's Inside

- `recon.sh` – Automates basic recon tasks
- `recon-cheatsheet.md` – Manual commands for subdomain enum, port scanning, dir bruteforce, and more
- Learning notes and tool references

chmod +x recon.sh
./recon.sh example.com
Outputs:
