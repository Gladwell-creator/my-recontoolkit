# 🔍 My Recon Toolkit

Hey there! I’m Gladwell, a beginner penetration tester learning ethical hacking from the ground up. This is my personal recon toolkit — a Bash script and cheatsheet I’m building as I grow my skills.

This project is part of my learning journey through platforms like TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and YouTube creators like The Cyber Mentor, STÖK, and NahamSec.


Welcome to my personal reconnaissance toolkit!  
This repo includes scripts, notes, and commands I use as I learn ethical hacking and penetration testing — one scan at a time.
